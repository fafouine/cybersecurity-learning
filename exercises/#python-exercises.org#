1. Create variables for your age, name, and favorite number
2. Print: "Hi, I'm [name], I'm [age] years old, and my favorite number is [num]"
3. Calculate: your age in days
4. Print: "That's approximately [days] days!)"

## First attempt

```python
age=30 
name="Johanie" 
num=5
print("Hi, I'm ",name," I'm ",age," years old, and my favorite number is ",num") # ERROR
days=age*365 
print("That's approximately ",days," days!") # ERROR
```

### what went wrong 
I called my variables as if I were using JavaScript.
In Python, to use the values of variables inside a string, you must pass a *function call* at the beggining of the string.
To do so you must add `f` before the beggining of the string and place the names of the variables between `{ }` like such: `f"string {variable} string"`

## Correction

```python
age=30 
name="Johanie" 
num=5
print(f"Hi, I'm {name}, I'm {age} years old, and my favorite number is {num}")
days=age*365 
print(f"That's approximately {days} days!")
```
